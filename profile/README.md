# Sting9 Research Initiative

## Our Mission

The **Sting9 Research Initiative** is building the world's most comprehensive open-source dataset of phishing, smishing, and scam messages to train AI models capable of detecting malicious communications with 99.9% accuracy. By combining community contributions with existing datasets, we're creating a powerful resource to protect billions of users from digital deception.

## The Problem

Every day, millions of people receive fraudulent messages designed to steal their personal information, money, and digital identities. Current detection systems struggle to keep pace with evolving threats:

- **5.3 billion** phishing emails sent daily
- **$10.3 billion** lost to scams annually
- **1 in 3** people have fallen for phishing attempts
- **87%** of smishing attacks bypass current filters

## Our Approach

### 1. **Community-Driven Collection**
We're building a global network of contributors who submit suspected phishing and smishing messages. Every contribution helps our AI learn new attack patterns and tactics.

### 2. **Multi-Source Integration**
We aggregate and standardize data from:
- User submissions
- Partner organizations
- Academic research datasets
- Public threat intelligence feeds
- Honeypot networks

### 3. **Advanced AI Training**
Our machine learning models analyze:
- Message content and structure
- Sender patterns and metadata
- URL and attachment characteristics
- Social engineering tactics
- Cross-language threat patterns

### 4. **Open-Source Commitment**
All datasets and trained models will be freely available to:
- Researchers and academics
- Security companies
- App developers
- Non-profit organizations
- Anyone working to combat digital fraud

## How to Contribute

### Submit Messages
Forward suspicious emails and texts through:
- Web portal at sting9.org
- Email forwarding to submit@sting9.org
- API for bulk submissions
- Mobile app (coming soon)

### What We Collect
- **Emails**: Phishing, spear-phishing, business email compromise (BEC)
- **SMS/Text**: Smishing, spam texts, fraudulent alerts
- **Messaging Apps**: WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal scams
- **Social Media**: Fraudulent DMs and posts

### Privacy First
- All personal information is automatically redacted
- Submissions are anonymized
- No tracking of contributors
- GDPR and privacy law compliant
